<p>
Straight from the heart, I’m putting my writing up on my site in the hope that whoever reads it will take something away. In addition, I use it as a record of what I’ve gone through. One day, I will look back and see the result of the current grind where there is no end in sight. I do not know what the result of my work will be. However, I do have a small vision and I’m doing what I can to achieve it. 
<p>
I’m increasingly becoming a process-driven person. I used to not admit my own faults, but failure taught me a lasting lesson. Revisiting my past actions, I can see where I went wrong. Therefore, this writing is a way for me to reflect on what I’ve gone through and then learn from it. I go by the quote, “true learning comes from reflection on experiences”, and if I do not analyze the events that happen in my life, I miss out on lessons from the greatest teacher of them all. Life, it goes by too fast now that I’m working. Weeks feel like days to me… the workdays encompass one day and the weekends the other. Routines make the time go by even faster, and hopefully I see gradual progress day by day.
</p>
<p>
I want to commit to something and I view my work right now as half-done. Much of the information that I think is valuable is already in my head and it’s up to me to correctly tell my story. I am not that unique of a person and I’ve only shifted due to encountering a humbling failure, yet I am still going to try. I currently only have my effort to offer - even if it does not go well, it will be a learning experience.

While part of the book is already written, the majority is still in-progress. My journey through young-adulthood continues and I invite you to follow along with me. I will be trying to balance a career, a side business, love life, and friendships in the center of New York City. Who knows if I will succeed? Life is full of compromises and I’m no genius to figure out the key. I only crawl through the darkness of post-college life on the path to getting more established. I’ve been primed by NYU to the realities of life and it’s time for me to take a complete dive.
