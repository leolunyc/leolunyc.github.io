            <p>Got a solid job of around 40 hours per week, earning enough to afford a place that is cool during the summer and warm in the winter (with enough money to save for your 401k, Roth IRA, etc)?
            </p>

            <p>In your 20's or single and without any dependents? And in good health?
            </p>

            <p>Have something you feel strongly about, want to do or try, but hesitant to start?</p>

            <p>
              <u>I felt the same</u> for I am with you. I graduated from a top school and lived comfortably while wondering with my mind wandering; however, I am now executing on a dream and you can do the same. This site is here for that.
            </p>

            <h3>The power of introspection</h3>

            <p>I was stuck. Caught up in the dilemna of having too much choice, the noise dulled my senses to land me in analysis paralysis, a state of evaluating the pros and cons to a variety of paths to take without the starting the journey to any. Just as if I were opening doors slightly to take a peek without actually stepping in.</p>

            <p>Exhausting my mental energy, I conducted external analysis when I should have been using introspection instead. Looking at what everyone thought was the ideal, not realizing that each one of us has his or her own interests. Luckily, through a series of events, I was brought back to a hobby of mine that started in high school: using the internet to produce content.
            </p>

            <p>Think about this - when I was a high schooler, I had a lot of work to do in the form of homework, studying, and track practice that there was limited free time. I could have been using this down time to play videogames or hang out with friends, but spent much of it creating a YouTube channel, reselling electronics on eBay, and writing on Yahoo! Geocities (what a throwback!). I was doing what I loved.<p>

            <h3>What this site is about</h3>

            <p>5 years after high school ended, I'm back doing what I used to do, except now equipped with so much more. No more tests. A steady income to fund my hobby. A place to live in the great New York City to thrive in.</p>

            <p>But I'm not the only one.</p>

            <p>This is a showcase of dreamchasers to show that there is no need to make reckless decisions such as quitting your job to travel the world in order to start something. To make the argument that it takes time and a boatload of work, just as how a violinist's smooth bowing, so easy-looking, took years of practice to perfect. That you are not alone.</p>

            <p>Equally as important, I will include in the content practical steps from those featured on <u>how to start</u> (in the respective fields), how to take a simple action that could be done right after reading or hearing what I upload, for every journey requires the first step. Read about each individual's background behind the interest, first step taken, and process of progress!</p>
