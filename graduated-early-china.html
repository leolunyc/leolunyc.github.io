						<p>
						Senior year was over for me in December and I had eight months to myself before starting a full-time job. This was the time for me to
						travel and try what I might not get the second chance to, and so I spent three months in China where I worked two different jobs, traveled both within Shanghai and outside of the city, and spent a great deal of time alone in reflection.
					 </p>

					<p>
					Finishing up school, I headed home to celebrate the winter holidays with my family, giving myself a well-deserved period of relaxation. Since I had a job lined up and was going to go to Shanghai in February, I decided I might as well use January to chill. Thus, I spent the whole month of January holed-up in my house where I watched many YouTube videos, ate unhealthily, and just lounged around. For three weeks, I wholly endulged in these activities, but it eventually got old. Luckily, I got the being-a-couch-potatoe phase out of my system, which enabled me to fully experience my time across the world knowing all too well the limit to what I can get by staying home and entertaining myself with a computer screen.
					</p>

					<p>
					Having gotten sick of preparation due to how much I was practicing for interviews and studying for exams just a few weeks prior, I did little research on mapping out what my next three months would look like. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a unique balance for me in preparation versus winging it on my journeys. Before arriving in Shanghai, I spent a few days in Sydney and a few more in Melbourne, marking my first time traveling by myself. I’d only looked into the Australia trip a few days in advance with no expectations, thinking that I'd eventually figure everything out when I got there. And it worked. I simply looked up the most popular areas and just wandered around them, playing everything by ear.
</p>
<p>
					I did the same with my Shanghai plan by devising a rough plan of only a few action points, leaving the rest up in the air. With a part-time job as an English teaching assistant lined up a few weeks in advance of my adrival, I at least had some structure to my day. Yet, this job was only two nights a week, leaving me a good amount of time to myself - a blessing in the amount of freedom I had in dictating my days but also a challenge in trying to establish myself in a city where I knew so few people. I thus spent the first week and a half of my limited time just lounging around inside the apartment, hesitant to put myself out there. (I was living for free with my grandparents, if I had to find more ways to pay the bills I'm sure I would have stepped out of my comfort zone quicker)
</p>

					<p>
					I didn’t let that deter me as I got back up to prospect for a job, eventually landing an internship at a magazine as an editorial intern. In applying, I realized that my online applications were gaining little traction so I sent direct emails to editors at multiple firms to get their attention. Out of the ten cold emails I sent, I got two receptive responses where I explored the opportunity, and managed to secure one six-week internship on the editorial team at City Weekend.
					</p>

					<p>
					Originally, my plan was to intern at a startup in Shanghai, but that didn't work out because most of them required someone with native Chinese reading and writing skills. Little did I know how much transferrable experience I got out of this City Weekend internship. Ironically, I developed a newfound enjoyment in writing in English while in Shanghai, publishing six cafe reviews and covering various venue openings and events throughout the city. When given the responsibility to execute, I just stepped up to the plate. The only previous writing experience I had was from my college writing classes - none of my notes contained any guidance on how to describe the taste of coffee, insert specific text to maximize audience attention to promotion listings, or report on a story. Instead of academic knowledge, I turned to the real-life examples of others, learning from the more senior editors while understanding the workings of a small company. In this sense, I achieved my goal of wanting to learn more about how a business operated, seeing it first-hand in two work environments with 50 or fewer employees - a stark contrast to the 50,000+ person bank I currently work in.
					</p>

					<p>
					In addition to finding the work fairly enjoyable in a small-business environment, I liked my position of working in a new city. Unlike many that come to NYC after graduation, I’ve already spent four years here and have built a circle of friends already. This was not the case in Shanghai, where I felt like I was in-between two different worlds - I wasn’t an expat and so I didn’t fit into their lifestyle, as I lived with my grandparents. On the other hand, I grew up in America, which created cultural differences with the locals. I was also caught up between spending time with my grandparents as well as with new acquaintances, but I just had to make do. This meant having to sneak out in order to enjoy the nightlife of the city while "following my bedtime". I’d also use the internet for social purposes, attending meetup events and I even met up with someone from reddit! Meanwhile, I’d meet many friends of my family, learning an education in traditional Chinese values. Stepping out of my comfort zone was pivotal for me and I wish I had done even more to take advantage of the idea location of my grandparents’ apartment, but looking back I learned a great deal. The vast amount of attractions in Shanghai of parks, museums, and entertainment areas added to the fun.

					</p>

					<p>
					While I did have a considerable amount of alone time, I spent much of it in reflection. After securing a job offer, my mind was freed of thinking of how to get a job. I thought about more profound questions, such as how I could be best prepared to start my own business in the future, and what made me happy. I embarked on my post-graduation journey to experience that something different. I read a “Lolita” and felt similar to the main character in conducting internal dialogue inside of my mind. “How to get rich” gave me inspiration on Felix Dennis’ journey, learning about how he overcame the great difficulties of starting a company from nothing. My friend recommended a film called “Dance of Reality”, educating me on the difference between perception and reality. Various thoughts raced through my mind during this time, and after almost a year, through much self-doubt and questioning, I have come to partly answer them.

					</p>

					<p>
					It’s been almost a year since I’ve returned from China, and as time progresses I believe I can retroactively piece together the answers to the questions I pondered over during that time. Yes, I did not step completely out of my comfort zone in China, but I was still young and inexperienced back then. Working has increased my maturity and drive to change, but the trip to China remains a shaping moment in my life. I graduated a semester early to travel to Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Huangshan, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xi’an, and then Suzhou and Hangzhou to come back to NYC for my graduation ceremony. I got accustomed to being by myself and that helped significantly during my transition into post-college life.
