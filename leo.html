            <h3>Context</h3>

            <p>This is a podcast featuring myself.
              <br>
              <br>
              <u>Background of interest:</u> I became inspired to think abstractly and optimistically after reading books by Mark Manson (see his site at markmanson.net). Influenced by the audacious move he made of quitting his job in consulting to spend a few months working on an online business at home in his parents' basement, eventually gaining enough traction to afford a digital nomad lifestyle.
              <br>
              <br>
              Traveling the world and writing about it sounded appealing, but awfully risky - what if he fell into a depression or lost his motivation for the online business? A job in management consulting signals various competencies, but a work experience of only a few weeks shows the opposite. For me, it's better to hedge your bets and move forward both on the job and off work.
              <br>
              <br>
              <u>First Steps:</u> Having previous experience in blogging and YouTube videomaking, I took a free class on codeacadmy.com on HTML and CSS to build simple sites. Then, I used GitHub pages to host the site, redesigning the site three times to get to where it is now. Taking inspiration from Manu Goswami, a highly active LinkedIn user with over 50,000 followers (and a successful young entrepreneur), I began storytelling on the platform and have expanded onto Instagram.
              <br>
              <br>
              <u>Process:</u> Wake up at 7am on weekdays to send emails and work on personal projects before work. Go to the gym on Tues, Wed, Fri, and Sun. Refrain from using electronics one hour before going to bed. Use periods of the weekends for work and rest, not just play.
            </p>

            <h3>Thoughts as a consideration for action</h3>

            <p>I've already shared some action steps under "First Steps", so here are some thoughts that I echo on what to expect on the journey. Mindset is so important; once expectations are set, it's time to go.</p>

            <p><strong>What's most important to you will keep you grounded:</strong> Gary Vaynercuk, a great inspiration of mine and a motivator, occasionally talks about "eating shit". Of putting in long nights working while missing out on various activities. Our journeys are bound be include setbacks and sacrifices, but that's what we have to be open to in chasing the dream, prioritizing it over everything else - not being able to do some things but being able to do what is related to our missions.<p>

            <p><strong>Now is the time to start:</strong> When you are right out of college and working a decent job, the only thing that holds you back is yourself. What's the worst that can happen if you fail? Learn from it and try something else, then rinse and repeat. When you are older with a family of your own, it is much harder to bounce back, so take these shots right now for your future self to look back and think back in reflection rather than the wonder of "what if?"</p>

            <p><strong>Stay humble:</strong> This is for you all as much as it is for me. My friend recently compared the mainstream to fast food, and everyone knows a person or two with a condescending view of that cuisine. Holding their heads up high, they judge; I for one could always go for the occasional chicken McNuggest. If you are doing something different, that's great if it works for you. If not, then that's fine as well. The system was designed to work for the most amount of people and just because you are not part of it, that doesn't mean you are better.</p>
