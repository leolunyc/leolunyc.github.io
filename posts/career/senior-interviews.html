<h2>Lessons from over 40 interviews in one semester </h2>
  
  <p>
  	***I’ve included a spreadsheet of the data I collected from my interviews, which can be found under the "Resources" tab***
 </p>

<p>I was ready for a tough fall semester of senior year, but never imagined it to be so hectic. If the work to secure a junior internship was difficult, finding a full-time job is on a whole new level. I went through a tenuous ordeal and learned a lot along the way. In addition to taking five classes, living in a loud apartment with six roommates, and handling club activities, I went through 46 first round interviews and 11 final round interviews to land where I am today. 
</p>

<p>Just like students, companies also face uncertainty in hiring undergraduates. How can they tell how well somebody can perform, given at most usually a relevant internship and degree? Well, companies conduct interviews. Sometimes they end up being a crapshoot. 
</p>

<p>
	It’s random because companies rely on emotions to pick the right people for the job, with the criteria of background fit (how well they think the person can do the job), personality fit (how much others would want to work with that person), and safety (how long will the person stay in this role). Ultimately, it’s important to craft a story depicting fit into the position.
</p>

  <p>
    <b>Can you do the work?</b>
 <br>
Companies want to see if you can do the job, and thus they look for relevant skills and experiences in candidates. Unfortunately for me, I did not have as specific of a skillset as others in such a competitive environment. For example, at tech companies and investment management companies, it was easier for them to pick the person who had taken computer science classes over me, who showed entrepreneurial spirit but did not have that training. They also want to see skill alignment, meaning having worked directly in a similar position - investment banking m&a positions would go for students who interned in the same group, even at a smaller bank, as opposed to me. I’m surprised I even got interviews to a bunch of companies, especially consulting positions, given the differences in my background to what they were looking for. Positions involving extremely technical work with derivative securities and even one requiring a CPA eventually gave me interviews, and obviously I did not fit. It was hard at first, but I eventually learned how to tailor my resume for various positions, emphasizing the transferability of my skillset to the specific position.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, an equalizer would be behavioural questions, which show a candidate’s projected ability to do the task. Examples of these questions would include “tell me a time when you failed” and “how do you work in groups?”. These questions involve reflecting on prior experience to deal with a new situation, and responses reveal an individual’s ability to present information in an organized manner. I came to respond better to these as my confidence grew. Leadership training programs at corporates focused heavily on these types of questions as they didn’t look for a specific background, just people who could do the job.
</p>
		
<p>
  <b>Do we like you?</b>
<br>
In addition to background fit, employers also want to find people they would want to work with. This is the social aspect, making the pre-interview networking sessions, Q&A part of the interview, and any other time to make a better impression vital to getting an offer. When I went to the meals or engagement activities (such as going to a lounge where they served alcohol) after the interview, I knew that it was also an important part of the process. I’d make an effort to get to know those who were there in a casual way, trying to have fun. It felt like rushing a fraternity - you’d want to have other things to talk about than just work. I took time to get better at making this small talk, a skill I continue to work on. It was also a matter of temperament. High-activity positions of investment banking ultimately became sales functions requiring a certain personality. Quantitative positions required a certain attention to detail, and all of these traits would be reflected in the people I met during the interviews. I had to think to myself, “would I fit in with this group?”
</p>

<p>
  <b>Will you stay?</b>
<br>
Then, there is safety - will the employee be a lasting asset to the company? It costs money for the company train new hires, and if they leave too early, they become a sunk investment. This is why the rotational programs are so keen on finding people who are the right fit. People who come in with the wrong expectations will get upset, and then they might leave. Finding those who know what they are getting into is crucial, and so companies ask candidates why they are interested in the role. It’s important to emphasize how well-suited you are for the role and how it also suits you, to give the sense that this is THE job you want out of the rest. I learned my lesson when my pay expectations were way over what they were offering, thereby discounting me from the role.
</p>
  
<p>
  <b>ETC</b>
  <br>
	Two additional factors come into play in recruiting: networking and confidence. As an undergraduate, I found networking to play a crucial role in securing on-campus recruiting interviews. By contacting alumni working at these firms and engaging with them in conversation, I was able to get a referral for four interviews. With this help, I separated myself from the pool of other students from my school by making the personal connection. In terms of confidence, I felt that I lost out the most because of this due to sub-optimal first impressions. I believe the shaping moments of the interview come in the beginning by giving a solid handshake and setting the mood of the interview up before any questions are asked by making small-talk, to then nailing the question of walking through your resume. 

<br>
<br>
An interview is an opportunity to tell a story, and a good story lies in both its contents and presentation. By explaining how your past experiences have prepared you for this job and why you are interested in it and saying so in a convincing manner, you will increase your performance in interviews as I have learned.
