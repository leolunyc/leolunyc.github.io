<h2>I graduated early to spend three months in China </h2>
  
  <p>
  I put myself through many trials by setting graduating a semester early, but also saved a ton of money. Moreso, I got to travel - I spent three months in China where I worked two different jobs, traveled both within Shanghai and outside of the city, and spent a great deal of time alone in reflection. I never looked back to wonder what it would be like as a second-semester senior.

 </p>

<p>
Finishing up school, I headed home to celebrate the winter holidays with my family, giving myself a well-deserved period of relaxation. I figured, since I had a job lined up and was going to go to Shanghai in February, I might as well use January to chill. Thus, I spent the whole month of January holed-up in my house where I watched many YouTube videos, ate unhealthily, and just lounged around. 

</p>

<p>
This lead to an ill-prepared start to my travels. Before arriving in Shanghai, I spent a few days in Sydney and a few more in Melbourne, marking my first time traveling by myself. I’d only looked into the Australia trip a few days in advance, setting little expectations to eventually figure everything out when I got there. And it worked. I simply looked up the most popular areas and just wandered around them, thereby setting up my semi-impromptu plans for Shanghai. Luckily, I had a part-time job lined up as a teaching assistant at a language school. Since the job was two nights a week, I was left with a good amount of time to myself; however, I was placed in a city where I knew very few people, and I spent the first week and a half of my limited time just lounging around inside the apartment.

I didn’t let that deter me as I got back up to prospect for a job, eventually landing an internship at a magazine as an editorial intern. I realized that my online applications were gaining little traction so I sent direct emails to editors at multiple firms to get their attention and it worked. 
</p>

<p>
Contrary to my original plans of working at a startup, the internship at the company taught me much in addition to my other tutoring position. I wanted to learn more about how a business operated, and got to see it first-hand in two work environments with 50 or fewer employees - a stark contrast to the 50,000+ person bank I currently work in. My supervisors were quite accommodating to me, allowing me to take on the projects that I suggested. In turn, I exercised my writing skills to review a few cafes in Shanghai, and got some exposure to the work of an English teacher. As someone who is not so good with little kids, I much preferred writing stories. If I were at a different school where there was less at stake, I’d heavily consider working at this company full-time instead of going into finance where I get more pay but find the work less enjoyable. 

</p>

<p>
In addition to finding the work fairly enjoyable in a small-business environment, I liked my position of working in a new city. Unlike many that come to NYC after graduation, I’ve already spent four years here and have built a circle of friends already. This was not the case in Shanghai, where I felt like I was in-between two different worlds - I wasn’t an expat and so I didn’t fit into their lifestyle of living alone and I grew up in America, which created cultural differences with the locals. I was also caught up between spending time with my grandparents as well as with new acquaintances, but I just had to make do. I would sneak out some nights to enjoy the nightlife of Shanghai. I’d also use the internet for social purposes, attending meetup events and I even met up with someone from reddit! Meanwhile, I’d meet many friends of my family, learning an education in traditional Chinese values. Stepping out of my comfort zone was pivotal for me and I wish I had done even more to take advantage of the idea location of my grandparents’ apartment, but looking back I learned a great deal. The vast amount of attractions in Shanghai of parks, museums, and entertainment areas were also fun.

While I did have a considerable amount of alone time, I spent much of it in reflection. After securing a job offer, my mind was freed of thinking of how to get a job. I thought about more profound questions, such as how I could be best prepared to start my own business in the future, and what made me happy. I embarked on my post-graduation journey to experience that something different. I read a “Lolita” and felt similar to the main character in conducting internal dialogue inside of my mind. “How to get rich” gave me inspiration on Felix Dennis’ journey, learning about how he overcame the great difficulties of starting a company from nothing. My friend recommended a film called “Dance of Reality”, educating me on the difference between perception and reality. Various thoughts raced through my mind during this time, and after almost a year, through much self-doubt and questioning, I have come to partly answer them. 

</p>

<p>
It’s been almost a year since I’ve returned from China, and as time progresses I believe I can retroactively piece together answers to the questions I pondered over during that time. Yes, I did not step completely out of my comfort zone in China, but I was still young and inexperienced back then. Working has increased my maturity and drive to change, but the trip to China remains a shaping moment in my life. I graduated a semester early to travel to Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Huangshan, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xi’an, and then Suzhou and Hangzhou to come back to NYC for my graduation ceremony. I got accustomed to being by myself and that helped significantly during my transition into post-college life.
