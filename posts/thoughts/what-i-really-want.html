<h2>What is it I really want</h2>
  
  <p>
I recently had a conversation with my ex-strategy consultant friend on careers, adding to my urgency to figure out what I want in life. I don’t know, and it will take time for me to find out. All I care about is being able to have a good life with a family and great friends, but while it may seem that I do have that right now, I don’t know how to be satisfied.

 </p>

<p>
I’m caught in analysis paralysis, faced with too many choices and not enough commitment. If I were to just pick a direction and then go, it would be so much easier. Unfortunately, my present situation does not provide me with enough information to go ahead with this. There is so much uncertainty in where I will end up within my company because I’m in a year-long rotational program, and I would like to place my bets in the most optimal direction possible. My relative inaction occurs as a result.

</p>

<p>
The only way for me to go about this is to revisit my values and make the most out of my current situation, despite the unknown. I used to conjure “what if’s” and plot out career paths in positions that I was not even currently in - I’d imagine working in consulting for one or two years to then jump to a startup in a more senior role with more responsibility, later moving to a smaller startup at an operating level. This seems good in theory, but currently impossible in practice because I’m not even in consulting right now, making it a waste of time to ponder over. I’m better off actually committing to building myself up to the point where I can take the leap if I choose to do so.

<p>
At the very least, the past eight months have not been a complete waste of time for me as I slowly worked on myself. I’d be surprised if anyone were able to perfectly nail their first few months of working adulthood, managing bills, roommate issues, relationships, all while focusing on a career and side hustle. I won’t get into the details, but I’ve learned much about exercise, read books, went to various networking events, and developed holistically. My other pieces will cover this self-development but I did make some progress, having come from a low starting point.

</p>

<p>
Moving forwards, as I finish the second of three parts of my rotation program, I develop a new sense of urgency to invest in myself. I will not rely on a single source of income. I will actually dedicate my time to the second job of working for me, a small business of one. The steps I’m taking right now include speaking with entrepreneurs in my existing network, slowly building up my online presence, and taking a step back to organize all that I’ve absorbed to fully learn from it. I’m basically keeping busy in order to not worry about this tough question. It prompts inaction and action is what I need most right now.

(I have since finished my second rotation so that sense of urgency has incread)
