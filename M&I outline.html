I know M&I is usually for people wanting to break in or explore new career paths,
but this is about optimization for those who already have offers.

It looks like there is one already...but here is my take.

"Post-offers: the end of the road... Or is it?"

You've worked hard for the past years to secure your full-time offer, and now it's time to cruise until work starts right? 

Well, that is one approach, but this period of time around senior fall semester through early summer can be used for 
a great many other purposes, and each action you take in investing in yourself will only be compounded in the future.

1. Immediate action steps that can be taken (will go into specifics)

-wardrobe update for both work and non-work environments. you don't want to be spending time thinking about this while working
-exercise. go play that sport you couldn't or get a gym routine going that can carry forward into your job
-nutrition. understand what foods are good for you and also quick. figure this out beforehand to have some go-to meals

2. Cross items off your bucket list/to-do list

-spend a little time every day studying for the CFA, GMAT, etc
-skydive/read x book/try out this new hobby
-travel

3. Use this time to take a risk

-now is the perfect time to start a business and put all of your time into it. the worst that could happen is it flops and you have a
finance job lined up
-don't worry about capital requirements. whatever money you have right now is not much considering you'll be making a good amount once
work starts, so invest it 
-you'll develop transferrable skills and have an experience that can carry forward into much of what you do in the future: 
generating leads, negotiation, product design. Also resiliency and an appetite for risk
